‚úÖ 1. What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform that offers a wide range of services like compute power, storage, databases, networking, security, analytics, and more.
It helps companies scale their infrastructure without owning physical servers.

‚úÖ 2. Key AWS Concepts
Concept	Description
Cloud Computing	On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.
IaaS	Infrastructure as a Service (EC2, S3, VPC).
PaaS	Platform as a Service (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS).
SaaS	Software as a Service (Gmail, Office 365).

‚úÖ 3. AWS Global Infrastructure
Regions ‚Üí Geographical locations (ex: us-east-1, ap-south-1).
Availability Zones (AZ) ‚Üí Isolated data centers in a Region.
Edge Locations ‚Üí Used by CloudFront (CDN).

‚úÖ 4. Core AWS Services
1Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Services
‚ûî EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Launch virtual servers (instances).
Example:
Launch EC2 instance (Amazon Linux).
SSH Access Example:
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@ec2-public-ip
‚ûî Lambda (Serverless Compute)
Run code without managing servers.
Example: Simple Python Lambda function
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello from AWS Lambda!'
    }

2Ô∏è‚É£ Storage Services
‚ûî S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Object storage for files.
Example: Upload file using AWS CLI
aws s3 cp sample.txt s3://my-bucket-name/sample.txt
‚ûî EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Persistent block-level storage attached to EC2.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Services
‚ûî RDS (Relational Database Service)
Managed SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Example: Connect to RDS
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
‚ûî DynamoDB

Isolated network.
Example Components of VPC
Subnets
Route Tables
Internet Gateway (IGW)
Security Groups
‚ûî CloudFront
Content Delivery Network (CDN).
Use Case Example: Distribute static website assets globally with low latency.

Create Users, Roles, Policies.
Example: Create IAM User CLI
aws iam create-user --user-name AnilUser
Example: Attach Policy
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name AnilUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess

‚úÖ 6. Monitoring & Logging
‚ûî CloudWatch

Example: Create CloudWatch Alarm

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --alarm-name HighCPUUtilization \
    --metric-name CPUUtilization \
    --namespace AWS/EC2 \
    --statistic Average \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 80 \
    --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
    --evaluation-periods 2 \
    --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:my-sns-topic

‚ûî CloudTrail
Track API activity and changes.

‚úÖ 7. Deployment & Automation
‚ûî CloudFormation
Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Example: Simple CloudFormation YAML Template

Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890

Step 3: Upload Files
aws s3 cp index.html s3://my-website-bucket/index.html

Step 4: Configure CloudFront

Create distribution via AWS Console.

Use S3 bucket as origin.

‚úÖ 9. Basic Pricing Concept
EC2: Pay per second.
S3: Pay per GB stored.
Lambda: Pay per request and compute time.

Set up multi-AZ for RDS for High Availability.
Use security groups to allow only required ports.

‚úÖ 11. Useful AWS CLI Commands
Command	Description
aws s3 ls	List S3 buckets
